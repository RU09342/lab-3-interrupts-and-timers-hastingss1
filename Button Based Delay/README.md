# Button Based Delay
Sean Hastings: For button based delay, the led initially blinks at a default rate of 10 hz. Using a button and timer interrupt, the blink speed of the led was updated by timing when the button is pressed and then subsequently depressed. The difference between the button being pressed and then depressed is stored in CCR1 which in turn changes the blink rate of the led. Since continuous mode is used, it is possible for the timer to overflow. If statements are in place to check for this and ID_3 is used to allow the timer to run longer before overflowing.
